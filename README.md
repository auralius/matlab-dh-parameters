# DH-Parameters with MATLAB

Simple and straight-forward implementation of DH-parameters in MATLAB  
This can be used to execute forward kinematics of the robot to find position and orientation of every link of the robot.  

Feature:  
* Forward kinematics
* Homogenous transformation of each link of the robot
* Numerical jacobian
* Simple visualization, it can also be animated
